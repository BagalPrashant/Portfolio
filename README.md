## About Me
Hi! I'm Melissa Shi! I'm currently a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I'm pursuing a major in Computer Science. My academic journey is fueled by a deep fascination with the intersection of technology and human interaction, which steers my research interests towards social computing, machine learning, deep learning, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Through my studies and projects, I aim to explore how these cutting-edge technologies can be harnessed to enhance our understanding and improvement of social processes and interactions in the digital age.
